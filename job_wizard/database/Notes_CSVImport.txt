To import CSV files into SQLITE:

sqlite3 [dbname]
.mode csv
.import [file] [table]

NOTE that even though the ID columns in the job_wizard DB are flagged as
"autoincrement", SQLITE does not really support this. So we have to provide ID
values explicitly in the CSV files.

Above assumes no column headers in the file. I believe there is a way to tell
it to skip column headers.
