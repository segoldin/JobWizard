# JobWizard

This is a demo application developed to support my course "Designing and Implementing User Interfaces". It provides a simple, consistent back end that can be accessed via command line arguments or a REST API. Students can thus produce UIs that are clearly separated from the program functionality and can focus on issues such as clear logic and flow, and effective, user-friendly presentation. 

The application is a simple job search program that allows users to post, search and apply for employment. It is not intended to be realistic but hopefully provides sufficient complexity to support a non-trivial front end. 

The program is written in Go and uses SQLite for its database. It can be run either as a standalone executable or as a web service.
